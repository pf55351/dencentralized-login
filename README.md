# Decentralized Login with Metamask
Simple demo of how to sign-in in a decentralized way using Metamask.  
The project includes a frontend written in ReacJS, and a backend written in NodeJs/Express.  
The frontend and backend use Web3JS to sign and verify a message.  
The backend uses Redis for caching and MongoDB to store user information.
